<h1>Checkmate Finder</h1>
<hr />
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
  There have been many checkmate potentials that players seem to miss. Players
  have been training for finding checkmates through chess checkmate puzzles.
  Such problems can be solved using a simple depth-limited search and
  backtracking algorithm with legal moves as the searching paths.
